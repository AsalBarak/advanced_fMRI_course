I am uploading here some of the course material I used as a teaching assistant for the advanced fMRI course at the University of Birmingham (UK).

I am only putting here material I created. If you want to have access to the slides of the lectures (that I did not make/compile), get in touch and I should be able to get hold of them.

I am currently updating the [online resources](#OnlineResources.md) and [reading list](#OnlineResources.md) documents so they are still very much work in progress.

The `Practical` folders contain some of the workshop that were run for that course. I still need to check that everything is there and works as intended.

The `Revision` folder contains the slides (Latex beamer style) for the revision session that was organized before the final exam of the course. The current version has the answer to each question commented out. If you want a set of slides with the answers, remove the comments and recompile the pdf.  I have left a version of this file on [overleaf](https://www.overleaf.com/read/rhrwvpzxcxhq)
